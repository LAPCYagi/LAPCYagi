# Yagi_404

### Presentation

Hello ! My pseudo (beaucause, you know, anonymous stuffs on internet...)
is Yagi_404 and I am learning code. I'm french, so if my apps are little bit in french,
please don't pay attention to the commits, code and ohter things that you
can see in french.
I have already done, as you can see on my repos, some basics applications
and other.

I'm not looking for any job...

### How I started

I started because I had a homework to do, and I was wondering if I
could make my own game. And the only thing I know was use _a little bit_ the
Windows terminal (just `cd` and `dir`). So, I searched "How to do a game
with the terminal ?" and, you gessed it, my first programming language was **Batch*de*...

*A little exemple of **Batch*** :
```bat
@echo off
title Exemple
cls

:: Write "Hello World!" in a infinite loop

:loop
echo Hello World!
goto :loop
```
As you can see, it's primitive...

### Wich language I learned (with an exemple)

• Batch
```bat
@echo off
echo Hello Batch
pause
```
• HTML
```html
<html>
    <body>
        <p>
            Hello HTML
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
```
• CSS
```css
p {
    font-family: Arial;
    color: green;
}
html{
    background-color: black;
}
```
• JS
```js
console.log("Hello JS");
```
• Python (Discord.py first and "vanilla")
```py
# Ok, everyone know this one
print("Hello Python")
```
• Java (What I'm learning at the time)
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
         System.out.prinln("Hello Java");
    }
}
```
